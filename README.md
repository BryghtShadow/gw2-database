#gw2-database
An approach to create and maintain GW2 related databases from the GW2 API. The main reason behind this is to bot-edit the wikis, also copy/paste creation of articles and maintain interwikis as comfortable as possible.
Of course these databases could be used for any other stuff - feel free to grab them and unleash your ideas ;)

## Requirements
- A local webserver like [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/xampp.html) is helpful ;)
- **PHP 5.5+**. Why? Because [array_column()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-column.php) and fancy [array syntax and dereferencing](http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php)
- **MySQL** or **MariaDB**

XAMPP is great and easy to install but i prefer to create my own AMP mix with the 64bit Apache/PHP releases from [Apache Lounge](http://www.apachelounge.com/) and MariaDB

##Disclaimer!
Some of these files are currently a total mess, especially the wikicode related, beause wikicode is a mess too! I don't take responsibility for molten CPUs, smashed keyboards, broken screens etc. Use at your own risk! ;)
